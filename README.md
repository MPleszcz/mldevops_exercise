## Task 0

The first things done with this repo are some initial steps that include:
- Setting up the repo according to instrucions provided [here](OVERVIEW.md#2-working-with-the-git-repository)
- Setting up a Dockerfile to containerize the project
- Copying project files from previous laboratories
- Creating this readme

All these steps were done on `feature/task_0` branch.
